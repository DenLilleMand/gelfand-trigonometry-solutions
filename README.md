# Solutions for Gelfand's *Trigonometry*

<p align="center"><img alt="Cover" src="images/cover.png" width="250"></p>

*Trigonometry* by Gelfand and Saul is often recommended as a precalculus text for self-study.
However, the lack of solutions for exercises can present a difficulties for those who are self-studying.
A [partial set of solutions for *Trignonometry*](https://jbeach50.weebly.com/gelfand--saul-trig-solutions.html) (odd numbered exercises only) has been published by John Beach.
It is hoped that this repository will eventually contain a complete set of solutions that can be downloaded in PDF format.
